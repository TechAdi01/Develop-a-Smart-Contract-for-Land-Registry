# Develop-a-Smart-Contract-for-Land-Registry
This project implements a decentralized land registry system using Ethereum smart contracts. It allows users to register land parcels, transfer ownership securely, and verify land details on the blockchain. Built with Solidity, this contract ensures transparency, immutability, and trust in land ownership records.
